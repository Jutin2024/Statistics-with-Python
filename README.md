# üìä Statistics with Python: A Code-First Approach

> ‚ÄúKnowing is not enough; we must apply. Being willing is not enough; we must do.‚Äù  
> ‚Äî *Leonardo da Vinci*

This quote captures the essence of my journey into statistics.

As I learned statistics, I constantly asked myself: *‚ÄúHow do I apply this knowledge in a practical, hands-on way?‚Äù* That curiosity led me to a course by **Matt Harrison** ‚Äî a practical, code-first approach to understanding the core techniques of statistical data analysis using Python.

This repository is a curated collection of code examples (with a few of my own twists) inspired by the course. It reflects my learning process and serves as a reference for anyone looking to apply statistics using real-world tools and Python libraries.

Whether you're working with data collection, cleaning, exploration, visualization, or predictive modeling ‚Äî this repo showcases how Python can help unlock the power of data through code.

## Topics

- **Data Collection & Cleaning**: Learn how to gather and prepare your data for analysis.
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Summarize and visualize your data to uncover patterns and insights using Python libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
- **Summary Statistics**: Understand your data through descriptive statistics.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Build and evaluate models using:
  - Linear Regression
  - XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Learn to make data-driven decisions using statistical tests.
